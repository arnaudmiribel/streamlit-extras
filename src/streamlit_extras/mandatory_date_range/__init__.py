    Working with date_input with a date range is frustrating becuase if you're
    assuming you will get a start and end date out of it, your code can break (not
    to mention your type hints), because if a user clicks on just one date, the app
    will go ahead and run with a single output. This widget enforces a start and
    end date being selected, and will stop the app if only one is chosen.
